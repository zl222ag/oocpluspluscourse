/**********************************************************************
 File:		TakeFive.h  -  header file for class TakeFive
 Summary:	Class TakeFive produces objects that play "Naughts and Crosses"
			(Swedish "Luffarschack"). The caller determines whether or not
			the object itself determines the target position for the move
			or if the caller supplies row and column coordinates.
			The only rule enforced by the object is that even if any player
			may start a game, no player may make two or more moves in a row.
			When game is over, the object may be reused for next play, or
			replaced by a new object. Both ways are possible. Use method
			startNewGame() if you want to reset the object for next game.
